## Sharpen your thinking.

The free and flexible app for your private thoughts.

![Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/images/screenshot-1.0-hero-combo.png)

Your thoughts are yours.

Obsidian stores notes privately on your device, so you can access them quickly, even offline. No one else can read them, not even us.

Your mind is unique.

With [thousands of plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins) and themes, you can shape Obsidian to fit your way of thinking.

Your knowledge should last.

Obsidian uses open file formats, so you're never locked in. You own your data for the long term.
