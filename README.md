# Obsidian Empty Vault
This empty vault is based off Steph Ango: https://stephango.com/vault

Instead of dumping all the notes into the root folder this vault uses QuickAdd to create notes in assigned folders

To use just copy all the files and directories into an empty directory then open the directory in Obsidian as a vault.
