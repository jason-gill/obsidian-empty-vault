# Description
Most near-death experiencers see the light. Steve Kang went the other direction."There were demons everywhere. Three-to-four stories tall with capes and weapons. I knew they were in charge of this place called hell."  
Raised Buddhist, dedicated to becoming a monk, praying eight hours daily—Steve had his spiritual life figured out. Then a laced drug at a party kept him awake for ten straight days. Buddhist artifacts started making poltergeist noises. A voice claiming to be his god offered a deal: kill yourself for a better afterlife. So he did.  
During surgery after his suicide attempt, Steve landed in a place Buddhists don't believe exists: hell. Crowded. Dark with no sun. A purplish-red wasteland with massive demons and torture cages. And the certain knowledge: "I'm going to be here forever."  
But that wasn't the end of the story. As he was fighting for his life and experiencing the realities of hell, eight Christian ministers showed up to pray for a Buddhist kid they'd never met. In those moments, Steve shares how Jesus appeared to him in hell, offering love and rescue when he least deserved it. In this unbelievable story of salvation and redemption, Steve gets a second chance at life. His encounter became the turning point that not only saved him from death but also transformed his entire understanding of God, salvation, and purpose. Today, Steve shares his story as a testament to the reality of the afterlife and the radical love that pursues us even in our darkest moments.
